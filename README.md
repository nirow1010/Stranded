# Stranded

In this game, you play as a CIA agent: “The Agent.” After obtaining valuable information from behind enemy lines, he attempts to steal a fighter jet to make a speedy trip home. Unfortunately, his unusual route is spotted on the radar, and the enemy shoots him down, destroying the plane and sending him into free fall. Luckily, the Agent manages to survive using a parachute, but harsh winds blow him away from the crashed plane and into a forest, leaving him stranded. As time starts to pass, the Agent begins to feel hungry, thirsty, and cold. To make matters worse, he can also hear the distant howling of wolves echo throughout the forest. Thankfully, not all hope is lost, as The Agent knows how to makeshift craft, fish, forage, and hunt. He estimates that he has about 30 days to survive and hopefully be rescued before inevitably succumbing to the dawn of Winter. Conveniently, he remembers that there was a radio within the crashed jet, and decides that finding it may be the easiest way to find help and be rescued.
